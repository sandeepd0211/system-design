# URL Shortener System Design

This project presents the **system design** of a scalable and performant URL Shortener service (like TinyURL or Bitly). The goal is to demonstrate high-level and low-level design skills, architechtural decision-making, and readiness for real-world implementation.

> This repo starts with the design documentation and will later be extended to a working backend system.

## Problem Statement

Design a system that:

- Converts long URLs into unique, short aliases.
- Redirects short URLs to the original long URL.
- Optionally supports expiration, analytics and custom aliases.
- It is highly available, low latency, and horizontally scalable.

## Functional Requirements

- `POST /shorten`: Create a short URL for a given long URL.
- `GET /short-code`: Redirect to the original URL
- Expiry: Optional TTL for each short URL.
- Prevent short code reuse immediately after deletion.
- (Optional) Analytics: Track click counts, region, timestamp
