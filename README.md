# System Design Projects

Welcome to my **System Design Portfolio** - a curated collection of design explorations, architectural decisions, and real-world engineering problems. These projects are part of my journey to deepen my understanding of building **scalable, reliable, and maintainable distributed systems**.

> I am a Software Engineer focused on Full-Stack Development, and focusing on Database & System Design.

> This repo reflects how I approach real-world system problems - with practical, production-minded thinking.

## What You'll Find here

Each folder in this repo represents a full **System Design Case Study**, including:

- Problem definition and functional requirements.
- High-Level Design (HLD): architectural diagrams, scaling strategies.
- Low-Level Design (LLD): API contracts, DB schemas, sequence flows.
- Design trade-offs and decision records
- (Optional) Backend implementations

All content is written in Markdown and includes diagrams using Draw.io / ExcalliDraw

## Why I'm Doing This

System Design is a critical part of builing production systems. While I work with real-world services daily, I'm using this repo to:

- Document reusable patterns and learnings
- Practice communicating architecture through diagrams and markdown
- Explore how real systems evolve into products
- Bridge the gap between engineering execution and design thinking

This is not an attempt to play the role of an Architect -- rather, a focused effort to grow deeper as a **Software Engineer who can reason about design trade-offs and scalability concerns**.
